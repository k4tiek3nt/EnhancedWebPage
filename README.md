# EnhancedWebPage
Same Webpage as SimpleWebPage but enhanced to work with Java and GoogleAPI for Books

I took the info about Bag of Bones and restructured it to be a webpage about both More Information about Bag of Bones and Stephen King Books in general.

The content is not very advanced, the purpose of this for me was to start using more CSS and integrating JavaScript to work with a Public API.

I chose this theme I created because it is October and one of my Favorite Authors is Stephen King.

I updated my somewhat generic CSS to look like both Candy Corn and Reese's. 

The background color is Orange - Halloween inspiring, the buttons look like Chocolates, and the text brings in the Candy Corn colors.

In order to start the learning process it was fun to be imaginative and play around with what can be done.

This process helped me understand how to translate what I wanted to see into reality on the screen
through the use of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

As a side note, I'm not a fan of the candy corn taste, but it makes me think of October and Halloween.
I've tried it many times, and every time it was like ... yeah still don't like it. But that is the power of making
something look visually appealing. You may still, against your better judgement, be willing to try something
that looks like it might be tasty. Which is an important concept psychologically when designing a UI.

First you bring in the customer and tempt them to keep looking and hopefully buy whatever you are selling.
