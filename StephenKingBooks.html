      If you are a horror book fan, then I highly recommend you read this book. Rarely do I find a book where everything around me fades out.
      <h3>Spoiler Alert!</h3> <em>This is one of those books.</em>
      <blockquote>
        [Bag of Bones] focuses on an author who suffers severe writer's block and delusions at an isolated lake house four years after the death of his wife. The book re-uses many basic plot elements of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, which is 
        directly referenced several times in the book's opening pages; however, the relation of these elements (including a wife who is dead as the book 
        opens, her posthumous effect on future romance, a drowning, and house haunted by the memories of previous inhabitants) to the plot and 
        characters is markedly different. <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_Bones">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_Bones</a></cite>
